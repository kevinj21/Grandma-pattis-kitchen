							            <h2>Meet Grandma Patti</h2>
							            <p>Pattiâ€™s love of baking started long before she earned the name grandma, and somewhere around the time when she was growing up in Binghampton, New York.  She has always found fun in the art of cooking, along with the task of finding new recipes and methods of combining the best tastes and ingredients.</p>

							            <p>Freezer jam became her specialty many years ago, to which many of her friends, family and neighbors can attest to benefitting from. When her children kept returning with empty jam jars, and friends and neighbors began asking where they could get more of her jam, she knew she had created something special. Patti continued dabbling in other ideas and recipes, and came up with her unique brownie pizzas which have also been a huge hit. </p> 

							            <p>Spending time in the kitchen has provided Patti with an avenue to express her creative yet perfecting nature, a combination that brings out only the best of products, which she enjoys sharing with everyone.  </p>
